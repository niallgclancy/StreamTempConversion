Proof of concept for estimating monthly mean stream temperatures from instantaneous readings

Instantaneous readings of stream temperature are far more readily available than continuous data from water temperature loggers. Monthly mean temperatures are the "currency" for many fish~temperature studies, but logger data is only sometimes available to calculate monthly means. In this analysis, I determined if instantaneous readings can be used to estimate that stream's mean August temperature. Using data from continuously recording loggers across the continental United States, I determined the difference in temperatures between an instantaneous reading and continous readings on a nearby stream (within 50 miles) at that same time. This difference was then used to convert the mean August stream temperature of the continously logging stream to an estimate for the stream with the instantaneous reading. I then calculated the actual mean August stream temperature of the instantaneous stream and compared the estimated vs. true values. The mean difference between estimated and actual mean August stream temperatures was low (0.03 degrees C). This provides good evidence that estimating monthly mean temperatures from instantaneous readings is possible if there is a stream temperature logger within 50 miles.
